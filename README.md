# Responsive Portfolio Starter Site - PreLaunch Review

We are pleased to introduce you to your new starter portfolio web site! You now have the basic framework of a professional website to show off your work samples to prospective employers, clients and partners.  This README file is designed to introduce you to key features of version 1 and guide you on how to update the site as your work evolves.

## Getting Started

Your portfolio site has three pages: 
1. **Home** or **About** landing page with your name and biography
2. **Portfolio** page with representative images which will soon lead to your highlighted projects.
3. **Contact** page, for the amazed and intrigued people to contact you.  

Please check out the layout, style and content for each of the pages. You can request some modest adjustments to Version 1, as follows:

* Edit your biography
* Change your profile photo 
* Change the accent color (currently teal) and/or background color (currently grey)  
* Add links to your project pages once they are ready.

### Evolving With You

We expect that your site will naturally evolve over time, along with your work, and we're happy to support such updates. Simple text and link updates such as adding projects to the **Portfolio** page can be done at no charge, and we will give you an estimate for more complex changes. Email <jen@jaymedev.com> with a representative image and link for any portfolio projects to add, or a description of your envisioned upgrades. We typically respond within 48 hours.
