              Jen Jayme is a seasoned, dynamic leader with 20+ years of experience in fundraising,
              marketing and communications, and as of 2020, has expaned into full-stack
              web development. </p>

            <p class="bio black-text text-lighten-1 flow-text">She is passionate about inspiring and empowering
              underdogs and helping them find
              their voice: young people, small business owners, nonprofits and people who need a chance.
            </p>

            <p class="bio black-text text-lighten-1 flow-text">
              She's done it for 20+ years, having served in leadership roles at some incredible social
              impact organizations, including Community Action Marin, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Hispanic
              Scholarship Fund,
              St. Vincent de Paul Society, Santa Clara University, Techbridge, hospitals in Sonoma County and
              Spokane Washington, and educational institutions at high school elementary and university
              levels (UC Berkeley and Montessori, Waldorf and Catholic schools).
            </p>

            <p class="bio black-text text-lighten-1 flow-text">
              In her early career, Jen served as a consultant to nonprofits for San Francisco-based Laura
              Talmus Associates, then at a leading international firm, CCS Fundraising. Those roles gave her
              invaluable
              experience working closely with and learning from high net worth donors, veteran fundraisers, and
              extraordinary leaders at a broad range of philanthropic organizations.
            </p>

            <p class="bio black-text text-lighten-1 flow-text">
              Her work has included leading multi-million-dollar capital campaigns, establishing new
              major gift and fundraising programs, rebranding and overhauling agency websites and communications,
              and too many galas and fundraisers to count.
            </p>

            <p class="bio black-text text-lighten-1 flow-text">
              Jen was raised in the projects of East Boston by a single mother who worked her way from welfare to
              being a homeowner/landlord, and a father who began supporting his family at the age of 12. Both of
              parents grew up in deep poverty and become the first in their family to earn a college degree.
              Her career was shaped by childhood years in an inner-city neighborhood of concentrated poverty
              followed
              by high school years in affluent Marin County, California; the stark contrast in opportunities and
              culture between those communities had a profound impact on her. Jen has a passionate commitment to
              creating
              socioeconomic, racial and gender equity and a deep interest in youth development and trauma-informed
              care.
            </p>

            <p class="bio black-text text-lighten-1 flow-text">
              Jen earned an undergraduate B.A. in English with Honors from U.C. Berkeley, and is currently
              working toward a certificate in full-stack web development at an intensive Coding Boot Camp at UC
              Berkeley.
              She lives in Novato, in beautiful Marin County, with her husband and 11-year-old son. When not
              working, she enjoys
              supporting her son's career as a champion martial arts athlete, as well as snowboarding, baking,
              reading, tinkering, and painting.
