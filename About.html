                <p>
                    Jen Jayme is a seasoned, dynamic leader with 20+ years of experience in fundraising,
                    marketing and communications, and as of 2020, has expaned into full-stack
                    web development. </p>

                <p>She is passionate about inspiring and empowering underdogs and helping them find
                    their voice: young people, small business owners, nonprofits and people who need a chance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She's done it for 20+ years, having served in leadership roles at some incredible social
                    impact organizations, including Community Action Marin, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Hispanic
                    Scholarship Fund,
                    St. Vincent de Paul Society, Santa Clara University, Techbridge, hospitals in Sonoma County and
                    Spokane Washington, and educational institutions at high school elementary and university
                    levels (UC Berkeley and Montessori, Waldorf and Catholic schools).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In her early career, Jen served as a consultant to nonprofits for San Francisco-based Laura
                    Talmus Associates, then at a leading international firm, CCS Fundraising. Those roles gave her
                    invaluable
                    experience working closely with and learning from high net worth donors, veteran fundraisers, and
                    extraordinary leaders at a broad range of philanthropic organizations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her work has included leading multi-million-dollar capital campaigns, establishing new
                    major gift and fundraising programs, rebranding and overhauling agency websites and communications,
                    and too many galas and fundraisers to count.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jen was raised in the projects of East Boston by a single mother who worked her way from welfare to
                    being a homeowner/landlord, and a father who began supporting his family at the age of 12. Both of
                    parents grew up in deep poverty and become the first in their family to earn a college degree.
                    Her career was shaped by childhood years in an inner-city neighborhood of concentrated poverty
                    followed
                    by high school years in affluent Marin County, California; the stark contrast in opportunities and
                    culture between those communities had a profound impact on her. Jen has a passionate commitment to
                    creating
                    socioeconomic, racial and gender equity and a deep interest in youth development and trauma-informed
                    care.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jen earned an undergraduate B.A. in English with Honors from U.C. Berkeley, and is currently
                    working toward a certificate in full-stack web development at an intensive Coding Boot Camp at UC
                    Berkeley.
                    She lives in Novato, in beautiful Marin County, with her husband and 11-year-old son. When not
                    working, she enjoys
                    supporting her son's career as a champion martial arts athlete, as well as snowboarding, baking,
                    reading, tinkering, and painting.
